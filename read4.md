# CSS grid:

is now supported in Samsung internet v6.2 and many other modern browsers and has been the answer to many a prayer of web developers everywhere. In the same way that flexbox gave us a way to layout block elements next to each other, CSS grid lets us not only arrange elements in a row or a column, but in multiple rows and columns. Finally two dimensional layouts are becoming simpler!

When I was learning CSS and HTML the way that I learnt best was by copying layouts written by others and then changing bits, deleting bits and playing around with them until I understood what was going on. With that in mind, I’ve composed a few common responsive website layouts for you to copy, edit, mess around with. I’ll go over my thinking with each layout and will outline a few tricks from each one. (NB, you may have noticed that I’m not a designer, so I hope you like cats!). I’ve moved the CSS in each demo that is relevant to the layout up to the top of the CSS file in comment blocks so that you can see the important parts easily, don’t write your CSS like this.

## Conclusion

To wrap this up I would like to point the biggest drawback of using the second method, which is that if you want to remove content from your grid as your page gets smaller, you won’t be able to make that happen. Instead, it would be better to resort to mixing media queries in your stylesheet, that way at the same time that you change the grid template columns at each breakpoint, you can also set the display of the elements that should be hidden to display: none.

# Regex:

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).

Fields of application range from validation to parsing/replacing strings, passing through translating data to other formats and web scraping.
