# What google has learned about its quest to build the perfect team

reports have shown that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems
- better results and report higher job satisfaction

If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together
After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams

The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another
- The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright

on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’

Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues

For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work

The paradox, of course, is that Google’s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.

## A Conversation about REST with my Brother

by Ryan Tomayko


That first part(HTTP) tells the browser what protocol to use
-  it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world

The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”
- provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to
- A web page is a “representation” of a resource
- concept that people are calling “Web Services” or "APIs". 
    - the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do
- We need to be able to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines.
- redirect -  asking one machine for something and that machine points you to another machine for the answer

HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page.

All in all the REST type of protocall seems to be a central location to allow machines to use the correct verb to the noun they are looking for on the internet.
