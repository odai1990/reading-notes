Node is partcularly suited for building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration. It's also a good fit for bulding API's .

It can also be used as a scripting language to automate repetitve or error prone tasks on your computer. It can also be used to write your own command line tool.

Node can also be used to buld cross-platform desktop apps.
