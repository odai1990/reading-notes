# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding
- The number of women in computer science plummeted after personal computer took over the market and were primarily marketed to men
- the culture around tech was dominated by men and largely it stayed that way

## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies
- only 3 major companies have anywhere close to a 50% female workforce
- the break down for major companies, congress and the F500 is a great example, how slowly these other enterprises change and how much bias is at play in propagating that.

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company
-  "Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones"
  - this is a great line that I think has a lot todo with why America doea as well as is does despite so many issues.
- Upon further research it is fascinating to look at a list of the most diverse countries in the world. While the US is 84 it is the 3rd most populus country.
- more fascinating is the countries at the top of the list.
