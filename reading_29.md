## Django Custom User
Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication and if you'd like a basic tutorial on how to implement log in, log out, sign up and so on see the Django Login and Logout tutorial for more.

However, for a real-world project, the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model instead. This provides far more flexibility down the line so, as a general rule, always use a custom user model for all new Django projects.

But how to implement one? The official documentation example is not actually what many Django experts recommend using. There is a far easier yet still powerful approach to starting off new Django projects with a custom user model which I'll demonstrate here.

Setup

To start, create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:



create and navigate into a dedicated directory called accounts for our code

install Django

make a new Django project called config

make a new app accounts

start the local web server

Here are the commands to run:



$ cd ~/Desktop

$ mkdir accounts && cd accounts

$ pipenv install django~=3.1.0

$ pipenv shell

(accounts) $ django-admin.py startproject config .

(accounts) $ python manage.py startapp accounts

(accounts) $ python manage.py runserver

Note that we did not run migrate to configure our database. It's important to wait until after we've created our new custom user model before doing so.



If you navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 youâ€™ll see the Django welcome screen.

Superuser

It's helpful to create a superuser that we can use to log in to the admin and test out log in/log out. On the command line type the following command and go through the prompts.



(accounts) $ python manage.py createsuperuser

Templates/Views/URLs

Our goal is a homepage with links to log in, log out, and sign up. Start by updating settings.py to use a project-level templates directory.



# config/settings.py

TEMPLATES = [

{


...

'DIRS': [str(BASE_DIR.joinpath('templates'))], # new


...

},

]

Then set the redirect links for log in and log out, which will both go to our home template. Add these two lines at the bottom of the file.



# config/settings.py

LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'

LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'

Create a new project-level templates folder and within it a registration folder as that's where Django will look for the log in template. We will also put our signup.html template in there.
