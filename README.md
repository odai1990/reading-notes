2. Obstacles : when you face a Obstacle not just leave or ignore it, just be focus and try to overcome it. don't let anything disturb you.

*for my i always take a deep breath when i face Obstacle and no not ignore it and face it.*

3. Effort : i want you to remember anything you do and how much you push yourself hard you will get what you want, it is not easy word.

*i have worked 3 jobs to just get a good job opportunity.*
