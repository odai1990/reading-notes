# Sending Form Data [MDN WEB DOCS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data)

At it's most basic, client/server arcitecture can be summarised as follows.A client sends a request to a server using HTTP protocol and the server answers the request, using the same protocol.

An HTML form is nothing more than a user friendly interface to configure a HTTP request.

The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.


## Action

The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.

The names and values of the non-file form controls are sent to the server as name=value pairs joined with ampersands. The action value should be a file on the server that can handle the incoming data, including ensuring server-side validation. The server then responds, generally handling the data and loading the URL defined by the action attribute, causing a new page load (or a refresh of the existing page, if the action points to the same page).

How the data is sent depends on the method attribute.

## Method

The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method.

Each time you want to reach a resource on the Web, the browser sends a request to a URL. An HTTP request consists of two parts: a header that contains a set of global metadata about the browser's capabilities, and a body that can contain information necessary for the server to process the specific request.

### Get Method

This method is used by the browser to ask the server to git back a given resource.

### Post Method

It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.
