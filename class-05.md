## CSS Color

***`You have three ways to add color`***

<br/>

* rgb values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90).
* hex codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80.
* color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan


> Color : to change text color.
> background-color : to chnage background color.
> opacity, rgba 

* Contrast : When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

## hsl, hsla


**`The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an
alternative way to specify colors. The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside parentheses for:`**

* hue This is expressed as an angle
(between 0 and 360 degrees).
* saturation This is expressed as a percentage.
* lightness This is expressed as apercentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black.
* alpha This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0.
For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75 represents 75% transparency.

## Text

> font-family : The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.

> font-size : The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the
font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The most common are: pixels,percentages,ems.

> @font-face allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine.

> font-weight : The font-weight property allows you to create bold text. There are two values that this property commonly takes.

> font-style : If you want to create italic text, you can use the font-style
property. There are three values this property can take.

text giving it one of the following values: uppercase,lowercase,capitalize.

following values: none,underline,overline,line-through,blink.

> line-height : Leading (pronounced ledding) isa term typographers use for the
vertical space between lines of text. In a typeface, the part of a letter that drops beneath the baseline is called a descender, while the highest point of a letter is called the ascender. Leading is measured from the bottom of
the descender on one line to the top of the ascender on the next.

> letter-spacing, word-spacing : Kerning is the term typographers use for the space between each letter. You can control the space between each letter with the letter-spacing property.

## Choosing images for Your site:

A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

## storing Images on Your site:

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

As a website grows, keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized. Here you can see an example of the files for a website; all of the images are stored in a folder called images.

On a big site you might like to add subfolders inside the images folder. For example, images such as logos and buttons might sit in a folder called interface, product photographs might sit in a page called products, and images related to news might live in a folder called news.

# adding Images:

```
<img>
```
```
To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
```
```
src
```
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images â€” relative URLs
```
alt
```
This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

```
title
```
```
You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.
```



## Where to place Images In Your Code:

1. before a paragraph.
1. InsIde the start of a paragraph.
1. In the mIddle of a paragraph.


## aligning Images horizontally:

align:
The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has been removed from HTML5
and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images.


### The align attribute can take these horizontal values:

* left
* right
* top
* middle
* bottom

# CroppIng Images:

animated gifs:

Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.
