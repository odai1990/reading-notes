## Panda
-Object creation:

Creating a Series by passing a list of values, letting pandas create a default integer index.

Creating a DataFrame by passing a NumPy array, with a datetime index and labeled columns.

Creating a DataFrame by passing a dict of objects that can be converted to series-like.

The columns of the resulting DataFrame have different dtypes.

If you’re using IPython, tab completion for column names (as well as public attributes) is automatically enabled.

As you can see, the columns A, B, C, and D are automatically tab completed. E and F are there as well; the rest of the attributes have been truncated for brevity.

-Viewing data:

DataFrame.to_numpy() gives a NumPy representation of the underlying data. Note that this can be an expensive operation when your DataFrame has columns with different data types, which comes down to a fundamental difference between pandas and NumPy: NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array, while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column. When you call DataFrame.to_numpy(), pandas will find the NumPy dtype that can hold all of the dtypes in the DataFrame. This may end up being object, which requires casting every value to a Python object.

For df, our DataFrame of all floating-point values, DataFrame.to_numpy() is fast and doesn’t require copying data.

For df2, the DataFrame with multiple dtypes, DataFrame.to_numpy() is relatively expensive.

DataFrame.to_numpy() does not include the index or column labels in the output.

While standard Python / Numpy expressions for selecting and setting are intuitive and come in handy for interactive work, for production code, we recommend the optimized pandas data access methods, .at, .iat, .loc and .iloc.

-Missing data:

pandas primarily uses the value np.nan to represent missing data. It is by default not included in computations. See the Missing Data section.

Reindexing allows you to change/add/delete the index on a specified axis. This returns a copy of the data.

-String Methods:

Series is equipped with a set of string processing methods in the str attribute that make it easy to operate on each element of the array, as in the code snippet below. Note that pattern-matching in str generally uses regular expressions by default (and in some cases always uses them). See more at Vectorized String Methods.
