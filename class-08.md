## Position

* Normal flow : Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.

* Relative Positioning :  This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.

* absolute positioning : This positions the element in relation to its containing element.

> position:static ==> In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one.

> position:relative ==> Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

> position:absolute ==> When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page. (They act like it is not there.)

> position:fixed ==> Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
