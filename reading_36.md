# Graphs


**A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.**

Common terminology used when working with Graphs:

1- Vertex : A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
2- Edge : An edge is a connection between two nodes.
3- Neighbor : The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
4- Degree: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
