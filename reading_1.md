## Pain vs. Suffering

During the 10 weeks, students will face difficulties and they will feel pain on so many levels but tis pain it not purposeless, it will produce a good software developer. When students feel pain they are not suffering because suffering is pain without purpose.

## A beginner's guide to Big O notation

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

-	O(1)

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.



-	O(N)

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

-	O(N2)



O(N2) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set.



-	O(2N)

O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2N) function is exponential - starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically.

-	Logarithms



This type of algorithm is described as O(log N). The iterative halving of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase e.g. an input data set containing 10 items takes one second to complete, a data set containing 100 items takes two seconds, and a data set containing 1000 items will take three seconds. Doubling the size of the input data set has little effect on its growth as after a single iteration of the algorithm the data set will be halved and therefore on a par with an input data set half the size. This makes algorithms like binary search extremely efficient when dealing with large data sets.
