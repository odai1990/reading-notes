## Machine Learning Intro
-Exploratory analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and model training set the foundation for more advanced techniques.

-Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.


-Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.

-Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.

-Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.

-Model - a set of patterns learned from data.


-Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.

-Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

-Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.



-Supervised learning includes tasks for "labeled" data (i.e. you have a target variable).

In practice, it's often used as an advanced form of predictive modeling.

Each observation must be labeled with a "correct answer."

Only then can you build a predictive model because you must tell the algorithm what's "correct" while training it (hence, "supervising" it).

Regression is the task for modeling continuous target variables.

Classification is the task for modeling categorical (a.k.a. "class") target variables.

-Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning includes tasks for "unlabeled" data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).




In practice, it's often used either as a form of automated data analysis or automated signal extraction.

Unlabeled data has no predetermined "correct answer."

You'll allow the algorithm to directly learn patterns from the data (without "supervision").

Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning task, and it's for finding groups within your data.
